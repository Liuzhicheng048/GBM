All data used in this study are publicly available. RNA-seq data of TCGA-GBM are available through UCSC Xena website (https://xenabrowser.net/). RNA-seq data of CGGA cohort are available through the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database(http://www.cgga.org.cn). RNA-seq data of CHCC cohort are available through NODE database (https://www.biosino.org/node). the raw expression files of GSE108474 and GSE13041 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The drug response data of CCLs are available through CTRP (v.2.0, released October 2015, https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ctrp), GDSC (GDSC1&2, released October 2019, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/), and PRISM Repurposing dataset (19Q4, released December 2019, https://depmap.org/portal/prism/).
Full and detailed methods wereare presented in the supporting information (supplementary materials and methods), including driver mutation predictingprediction, clustering analysis, subclass prediction, CNV analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), single-cell RNA-seq analysis including transcription factor (TF) and pseudotime analysis, construction of prognostic risk signature, cancer cell line data, drug screen analysis, predicting drug response in subclass samples, immune microenvironment analysis, immunotherapy prediction and statistical analysis.
